# Directory.Build.props Proof of Concept

This repository is a proof of concept for the use of Directory.Build.props, a file used to set global properties and import custom targets for a project and its sub-directories.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository
- Open the solution in Visual Studio
- Take a look at the Directory.Build.props file in the root of the solution
- Observe how the properties and targets defined in this file are applied to the projects in the solution
## How it works
Directory.Build.props allows you to define properties and import custom targets that will be applied to all projects in a solution and its sub-directories. This allows for a consistent and organized way to manage build settings across the solution.

For more information on Directory.Build.props and how to use it, see the [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/customize-your-build?view=vs-2022).
